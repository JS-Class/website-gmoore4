    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      When I have free time I like to both watch and play basketball. I am
      mostly interested in watching and keeping up with the NBA rather than
      college basketball. <br>I also enjoy playing video games from time to time.
      Some of my favorite games to play include <em>NBA 2K, Madden,</em> and <em>Minecraft.</em>
      Another hobby of mine is working out and lifting.
