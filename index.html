    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Defiance, Ohio in 2001. I was raised and have lived in 
      Holgate, Ohio for my entire life. I currently work full-time as a 
      computer programmer. I am also attending classes at Northwest State 
      Community College. I am attending to get my Associate's degree in 
      Computer Programming as part of training for the job.

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>
      My mom and dad have been married since 1994. I have one older brother 
      named Tyler. He is five years older than I am. I live right across the 
      street from my grandpa. I have two dogs named Toby and Sadie.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      When I have free time I like to both watch and play basketball. I am 
      mostly interested in watching and keeping up with the NBA rather than 
      college basketball. I also enjoy playing video games from time to time. 
      Some of my favorite games to play include NBA 2K, Madden, and Minecraft.
      Another hobby of mine is working out and lifting.
