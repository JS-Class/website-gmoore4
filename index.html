      My mom and dad have been married since 1994. I have one older brother 
      named Tyler. He is five years older than I am. I live right across the

    <!--About my hobbies-->
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      When I have free time I like to both watch and play basketball. I am 
      mostly interested in watching and keeping up with the NBA rather than 
      college basketball. <br>I also enjoy playing video games from time to time. 
      Some of my favorite games to play include <em>NBA 2K, Madden,</em> and <em>Minecraft.</em>
      Another hobby of mine is working out and lifting.
